# CloudCard Image Server

CloudCard Image Server provides and API for accessing a Blackboard Transact (BbTS) database.

### Description
CloudCard Image Server was originally developed to allow [CloudCard](http://cloudcardtools.com) schools to import their cardholders' photos directly into their BbTS database. This saves the card office time and money and helps them provide faster service to their cardholders.

One of the added benefits of putting an CloudCard Image Server on top of the BbTS database was that it allowed applications other than CloudCard to access cardholder photos. We add super long, random, secure keys to each photo to allow photos to be used in websites while preventing mass image scraping by internet bots. 

### Features
- Provides secure access your cardholders' ID card images, so that you can display them in web pages and apps.
- Allows other applications (i.e. [CloudCard](http://cloudcardtools.com) to import images into your BbTS DB
